# Probhat Keyboard Layout for Mac OSX

This project provides the Probhat keyboard layout as a Mac OS native bundle. Probhat is one of the most popular keyboard layouts for the Bangla (aka Bengali) language.

This is faithful to the scheme published at [ekushey.org][e] <sup>[üèõ][w]</sup> with two variations:

- **Probhat (BD)**: BDT symbol (‡ß≥) on <kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>4</kbd>
- **Probhat (IN)**: INR symbol (‚Çπ) on <kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>4</kbd>

Layouts can be cycled from the menu bar as well by enabling the input menu item.
